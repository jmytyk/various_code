d6 has 3.3v pwm, at 3.3v --> clean, responds to change
lvl shift, 3.3v tx1, -> 5.06v tx0 (far left of ch1 )  --> clean, repsonds to change.
with dimmer line in circuit -- very noisy --> 60hz?  --> driver block diagram?

wired in Arduino --> 5v pwm... super clean signal --> no change in output with COB, or 12v LED strip... driver is not dimming??

trying other driver. 
no change... no output change on LED strip

and... Vf -- LEDs have a minimum voltage that they turn on, and for this array, that voltage, clearly written on the data sheet is 18v, using a bench power supply, it was 13.6 volts, still above the 12v that i was feeding it with the wall wart. 

dimming works great, LED is hot!

next up, how many drivers can we drive with 1 controller?  -> going i2c breakout route.
-verifed driving 16 pwm channels via i2c break out works
-pwm level is not 5v, but logic 3.3v
-can level shift them up on output side. 

see if putting level shifter on i2c results in level shift on outputs?  - this is the ideal use case.
--> works! 


--sourced 10 drivers, and matching LEDs and holders - powering with DC 600w AC/DC PSU. 
--sourced level shifters as well, they are bi-directional, is that an issue? 

code is moved and generally rewritten to use the pwm board. 

test / map the LUT table formuala it may need to be modified from 0-255 to 0-4095 usage. 

created a spline viz and output in the juypter notebook, 
-->can consume this json file on the mc side. 



need to work on the physical side of mounting and wiring 10 drivers, signal wires, power and such... 


what is the temperature of the LED after running for awhile?
